**YOU WILL NOW CEASE ALL INVESTIGATIONS INTO THIS OR ANY RELATED MATTERS.**

Everything you have experienced has been a training exercise from the Office of Incident Assessment and Response. You will disregard any information you may have been told otherwise.

* You will ignore all information you have discovered. It was fiction. 
* You will ignore all people you have interacted with. They were actors.
* You will forget all places you visited. They were irrelevant.
* You will destroy all physical items you have interacted with. They were props.
* You will destroy all documents you have saved or created during this exercise. They are lies.
* You will speak to no one of these events. They did not happen.

*IF YOU OR ANY PERSON ASSOCIATED WITH YOU VIOLATES THESE INSTRUCTIONS IT WILL BE CONSIDERED AN ACT OF TREASON AND TREATED ACCORDINGLY.*
