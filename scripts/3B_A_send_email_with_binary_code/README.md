# 3B-A: Ad interim email to nudge players for the timestamp

The players discovered the timestamp in the pdf document - hidden as binary code by positioning of the glitchy images.
Unfortunately, they havent conntected the number to a timestamp just yet. This email will send them the binary hidden in a gif 
this will push them back on track.
